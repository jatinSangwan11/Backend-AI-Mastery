# Notes

## OOP And LLD Intuition

Good backend design usually asks:

- What are the domain concepts?
- Which objects own which behavior?
- Which dependencies should be interfaces?
- What should be easy to extend later?
- What should be easy to test without real external services?

## Learning Method

We learn design through pressure, not memorization.

- Start from requirements.
- Write the simplest working code first.
- Notice what becomes painful.
- Discuss what Jatin thinks the problem is.
- Refactor only when the code gives us a real reason.
- Name SOLID principles and design patterns after we have felt the problem they solve.
- Build Python syntax muscle memory by typing real project code, tests, and refactors.
- Jatin owns coding-file edits by default; Codex edits code only when explicitly asked.
- Codex keeps markdown notes/progress focused on important intuition and revision points.

We do not use noun/verb extraction as the main design method. It is only a beginner fallback. Our stronger questions are:

- What decision is this code making?
- What changes together?
- What should be replaceable?
- What behavior needs isolated tests?
- What external dependency should be hidden?
- What would future engineers accidentally break?

## First Design Rule

Route handlers and top-level scripts should orchestrate. Domain and service objects should hold most business behavior.

## Bottleneck 01: Testing `print()`

Our first naive notification function used `print()` to show the email output.

Intuition:

- `print()` is a side effect.
- Side effects are harder to test than returned values.
- Since the function returns nothing, the only observable behavior is terminal output.
- Pytest's `capsys` fixture captures printed output so tests can assert on it.

This is a temporary solution. The awkwardness is useful: it shows pressure toward code that exposes behavior more cleanly.
